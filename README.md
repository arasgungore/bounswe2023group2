### :paperclip: Description of Our Project
Unfortunately, every year many people suffer from disasters. One recent example of such a disaster is the earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria, causing thousands of deaths and leaving many more suffering from cold, hunger, and thirst. With over 10 cities affected, logistics have collapsed and aid distribution has been poorly organized, resulting in some regions not receiving the aid they desperately need. To address this issue, we are developing a platform to facilitate the organization of relief teams and aid distribution.
