# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Disaster Response Platform (DaRP)

**Date:** 12.12.2023

## Progress Summary

On the Backend, we have worked on annotations. Implemented file upload and email verification feature, fixed a couple of apis.

On the Frontend, we created an event add form.

On Mobile, we created Event design and backend implementation. We also redesigned the details pages of need and resources. We also implemented buttons for directing user profile and some part of actions. Turkish language support is appended (most of the strings on UI are now defined in resources instead of hardcoded).

### Objectives for the following week
We plan to work on the following topics essentially as backend:
* Annotation
* Search
* Reset password
* Emergency
* Bug fixes, improvements.

## Planned vs. Actual
The overall plans of the group were hindered by factors such as distractions caused by other courses, health issues, or the concentration-disrupting effects of work life.

The group still managed to continue the work along the determined path.

Some comments by individual members are as follows:

Cahid: I slightly overestimated the durations of issues (because of the previous experiences). All issues were implemented on time.

Halil: I couldn't do Sort/Filter by Location and Date [#690](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group2/issues/690) because I was sick for 2 days. I will do it this week.

Can Bora: I was mostly focused on another exam, and I needed to delay the parts that depended on emergencies.

Egecan: Implementing and designing the event pages were harder than I expect. Therefore I couldn't focus on implementing connectionless creation for activities.

Şahin: Adding the sidePopUp has caused lots of bug due to old layout. Also, connecting to the API has resulted in some time loss for me. Therefore, the progress this week has been slower than planned; however, it is still going well. The restructured framework implemented this week will make easier resolution of future issues.

Hasan: Action implementation will be one of the key parts of our final milestone so I had to spend more time than I expected.

Burak: Implementing email verification service was slightly harder than I expected in terms of configuring the SMTP server, because it was easier in my previous experience with nodemailer than in Python. But still it was completed on time. 

We could not finalize action improvement this week. Because it needs more attention and collaboration. We also planned a meeting with Suzan Hoca. 
Additional bug fixes and improvements may not be planned but done.

## Risks

- We need to set our priorities well, failing to set priorities may result getting lost in unimportant details and failing to deliver the important artifacts.
- Should double check with both the requirements and user/customer impressions.
- To ensure that tasks are completed on time and that nothing is overlooked, a special level of concentration is required. The risk of neglecting issues (whether small or big) is higher on the last step.
