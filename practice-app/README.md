# Practice-App

This is a practice application developed by the team to learn and implement the basics of team application development practices. The objective of this project is to learn the following skills:

* Effective use of a personal development environment (IDE) that is connected to the team software development platform.
* Effective use of the Git versioning system to manage team code-base.
* Gain the skills to work with third-party services through a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API).
* Develop an API.
* Dockerize your application.
* Deploy your application to a server using docker.
## Project Objectives

In this assignment, we will develop a simple web application that includes developing an Application Programming Interface (API). We will learn how to use APIs as well as develop them. Each team member will utilize at least one API (of your choice) as well as offer an API function. That means every team member will consume an API call result and also create an API function. The API we will develop should be useful for our own team project. We are free to design the specific functionality that our API will offer – so long as it is well documented and is meaningful for our course project.

### Development Practices

In this assignment, we will work as a team. Our project repository will be extensively used for this purpose as it is specifically designed to support the development of software projects. Each member is responsible for documenting and tracking their work as well as reviewing the work of others.

### We will use the following development practices:

* Each member will use their preferred IDE that is connected to the team software development platform.
* We will use Git as our version control system to manage our code-base.
* We will work on feature branches and use pull requests for code reviews.
* We will use RESTful APIs to interact with third-party services.
* We will develop a meaningful API that will be useful for our team project.
* We will Dockerize our application to ensure consistency across environments.
* We will deploy our application to a server using Docker.
* Getting Started

### To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Create a new feature branch for your work.
* Implement your feature and commit your changes.
* Push your changes to the remote repository.
* Open a pull request for code review and approval.
* Once your changes have been approved, merge your feature branch into the main branch.
* Continue working on the next feature or bug fix.
